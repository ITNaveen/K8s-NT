Yes, the Service Port (port) acts as a middleman because:
✔ It knows which Pod(s) are running and where to send traffic
✔ It keeps networking stable, even if Pods restart or move
✔ It allows internal Pods to talk to this Pod without needing the nodePort

🚀 How Traffic Moves (Step-by-Step Explanation)
🌎 External Traffic (Coming from Outside Kubernetes)
1️⃣ User makes a request to http://<Node-IP>:32000 (nodePort)
2️⃣ Traffic enters the cluster and hits the Service on port: 5001
3️⃣ The Service looks at its Pod list and forwards traffic to targetPort: 5001 in the correct Pod
4️⃣ The application inside the Pod (listening on 5001) processes the request

✔ nodePort → port (Service) → targetPort (Pod)

🔁 Internal Pod-to-Pod Traffic (Inside the Cluster)
✅ Other Pods don’t use nodePort because they are inside Kubernetes
✅ Instead, they talk to the Service directly using port: 5001
✅ The Service then redirects traffic to targetPort: 5001 inside the correct Pod

✔ port (Service) → targetPort (Pod) (skips nodePort)

🛠 Why Both port and targetPort Are Needed for Internal Pods
🔹 Without port, internal Pods wouldn’t know how to reach this Pod reliably
🔹 Without targetPort, the Service wouldn’t know where the app is actually running inside the container

✔ For internal Pods, both port and targetPort are needed
✔ They skip nodePort and directly use port → targetPort

🎯 Final Answer
✔ port (Service Port) → Tracks which Pod is running and acts as the middleman
✔ targetPort → The real application port inside the Pod
✔ Internal Pods need both port and targetPort (but skip nodePort)
✔ External users must use nodePort → port → targetPort
