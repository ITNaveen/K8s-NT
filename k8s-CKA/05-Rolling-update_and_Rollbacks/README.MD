ROLLING-UPDATE - 
Here my current deployment on API is running on app_image with STATELESS tag and i want to do update fo image and lets say my new image has a tag of STATEFUL.

this way when i REAPPLY this deployment then it will start new pods first (in this case 2 new) and once they are up and running then it will terminate old one with OLD IMAGE.
NAME                                       READY   STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE
grade-submission-api-68d86c9744-wj689      1/1     Running       0          3s  ---new ones
grade-submission-api-68d86c9744-zvlfp      1/1     Running       0          9s
grade-submission-api-86f6464d8b-sjvjf      1/1     Terminating   0          11m  ----old ones 
grade-submission-api-86f6464d8b-xwk2p      1/1     Terminating   0          11m

ROLLBACK - 
Now if new image or deployment is not working then we can with the help of DEPLOYMENT CONTROLLER, come back to previous stage and so its called ROLLBACK.

# kubectl rollout undo deployment/grade-submission-api -n grade-submission 
write down the deployment name that needs to get undone and thats it, app is in previous stage.

Strategy for ROLLING_UPDATE -
we can specify under specs, how this rolling update can work, this defination goes under the SPECS of DEPLOYMENT after selector or replicas.
strategy:
      type: RollingUpdate
      rollingupdate:
        maxUnavailable: 50%
        maxSurge: 1  ---- it means k8s can creates 1 extra pod for temp bascic.


# it's spec.selector.matchLabels at the Deployment level and spec.template.metadata.labels at the Pod level.
this strategy defined under deployment label.
