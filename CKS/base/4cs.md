1️⃣ Code Security
🔹 Follow secure coding best practices (e.g., avoid hardcoded secrets, validate inputs).
🔹 Use static & dynamic security scanning tools (SAST, DAST).
🔹 Implement code reviews and security testing before deployment.
🔹 Manage dependencies properly to avoid vulnerabilities (use SBOM, software bill of materials).

2️⃣ Container Security
🔹 Use trusted & minimal base images (avoid unnecessary packages).
🔹 Scan images for vulnerabilities before deployment.
🔹 Implement sandboxing to isolate workloads.
🔹 Run containers with least privilege (avoid root user & privileged mode).
🔹 Restrict image sources (use signed images & private registries).

3️⃣ Cluster Security
🔹 Enable Authentication & Authorization (RBAC - Role-Based Access Control).
🔹 Use Network Policies to restrict communication between pods.
🔹 Implement Admission Controllers to enforce security policies.
🔹 Regularly update Kubernetes versions & apply security patches.
🔹 Enable audit logging & monitoring (e.g., Falco, OpenPolicyAgent).

4️⃣ Cloud/Infrastructure Security
🔹 Use secure IAM (Identity & Access Management) for cloud resources.
🔹 Encrypt data at rest & in transit.
🔹 Secure networking (VPC, firewall rules, restrict public access).
🔹 Implement CIS benchmarks for cloud security hardening.
🔹 Regularly monitor & audit logs for suspicious activity.
